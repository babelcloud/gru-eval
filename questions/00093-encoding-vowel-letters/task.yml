target: |-
  Write a function that takes a message, and encodes in such a 
      way that it swaps case of all letters, replaces all vowels in 
      the message with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of that 
      vowel in the english alphabet. 
      Assume only letters. 
      
      Examples:
examples:
  - usageExample: encode('test')
    output: '''TGST'''
  - usageExample: encode('This is a message')
    output: '''tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'''
tests:
  - input: '''TEST'''
    output: '''tgst'', "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"'
  - input: '''Mudasir'''
    output: '''mWDCSKR'', "This prints if this assert fails 2 (good for debugging!)"'
  - input: '''YES'''
    output: '''ygs'', "This prints if this assert fails 3 (good for debugging!)"'
  - input: '''This is a message'''
    output: >-
      'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG', "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for
      debugging!)"
  - input: '"I DoNt KnOw WhAt tO WrItE"'
    output: >-
