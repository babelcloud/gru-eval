target: >-
  You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of
  carrots,
      but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.
      you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,
                                      the number of carrots left after your meals ]
      if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.
      
      Example:
      * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]
      * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]
      * eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]
      * eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]
      
      Variables:
      @number : integer
          the number of carrots that you have eaten.
      @need : integer
          the number of carrots that you need to eat.
      @remaining : integer
          the number of remaining carrots thet exist in stock
      
      Constrain:
      * 0 <= number <= 1000
      * 0 <= need <= 1000
      * 0 <= remaining <= 1000

      Have fun :)
