  Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
      the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.
      Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
      tri(1) = 3
      tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
      tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
      For example:
      tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
      tri(4) = 3
      tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
             = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
      You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the 
      first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
      Examples:
      tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]
