  Given a positive integer n, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd
      integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.

      Example 1:

          Input: 3
          Output: (1, 2)
          Explanation:
          Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3. one of them is even, and two of them are odd.

      Example 2:

          Input: 12
          Output: (4, 6)
          Explanation:
          Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. four of them are even, and 6 of them are odd.

      Note:
          1. 1 <= n <= 10^3
          2. returned tuple has the number of even and odd integer palindromes respectively.

    output: '(5, 6)'
  - input: '19'
    output: '(4, 6)'
  - input: '9'
    output: '(4, 5), "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"'
  - input: '1'
    output: '(0, 1), "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"'
