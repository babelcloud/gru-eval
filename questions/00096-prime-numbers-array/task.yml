  Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array
  of the first n
      integers that are prime numbers and less than n.
      for example:
      count_up_to(5) => [2,3]
      count_up_to(11) => [2,3,5,7]
      count_up_to(0) => []
      count_up_to(20) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]
      count_up_to(1) => []
      count_up_to(18) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17]
examples: []
tests:
  - input: '5'
    output: '[2,3]'
  - input: '6'
    output: '[2,3,5]'
  - input: '7'
    output: '[2,3,5]'
  - input: '10'
    output: '[2,3,5,7]'
  - input: '0'
    output: '[]'
  - input: '22'
    output: '[2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]'
  - input: '1'
    output: '[]'
  - input: '18'
    output: '[2,3,5,7,11,13,17]'
  - input: '47'
    output: '[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43]'
  - input: '101'
    output: >-
      [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67,
      71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]
