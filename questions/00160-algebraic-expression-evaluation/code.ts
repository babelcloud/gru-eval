function doAlgebra(operator: string[], operand: number[]): number {
    // Given two lists operator, and operand. The first list has basic algebra operations, and 
    // the second list is a list of integers. Use the two given lists to build the algebraic 
    // expression and return the evaluation of this expression.

    // The basic algebra operations:
    // Addition ( + ) 
    // Subtraction ( - ) 
    // Multiplication ( * ) 
    // Floor division ( // ) - This operation is not directly supported in TypeScript.
    // Exponentiation ( ** ) 

    // We will represent the converted floor division using a custom function or inline calculation.
    
    // Example:
    // operators = ['+', '*', '-']
    // operand = [2, 3, 4, 5]
    // result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5
    // => result = 9

    // Note:
    // The length of the operator array is equal to the length of the operand array minus one.
    // Operand is an array of non-negative integers.
    // The operator array has at least one operator, and the operand array has at least two operands.
    
    // Your conversion of the Python code to build and evaluate the expression goes here.
