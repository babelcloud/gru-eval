function factorize(n: number): number[] {
    // Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    // Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    // Input number should be equal to the product of all factors
    // Example usage:
    // factorize(8) => returns [2, 2, 2]
    // factorize(25) => returns [5, 5]
    // factorize(70) => returns [2, 5, 7]
