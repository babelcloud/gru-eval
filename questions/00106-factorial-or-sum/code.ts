Here's the equivalent TypeScript code for the Python function signature you provided:


function f(n: number): number[] {
    // Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,
    // and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even
    // or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
    // i starts from 1.
    // the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).
    // Example:
    // f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
}


This TypeScript function signature matches the Python one you provided, but keep in mind that TypeScript uses arrays (denoted with brackets: `[]`) instead of lists. The function `f` expects a number as its parameter and returns an array of numbers.
